## Context and Problem Statement

We want to build this wallet as close to the community as possible. That's why, based on our software development experience, we decided to implement the RFC/ADR process. The most important architectural decisions should go through this process to hear the voice of the community.

## Considered Options

- Option 1: When we need to make a major architectural decision, we first post a Request for Comments and let the community voice their opinions and concerns for at least a few days. After most of the unknowns have been addressed, we can proceed to propose a decision in the Architecture Decision Record. If most of the core team agrees, the ADR gets a new status and should be respected accordingly.

## Decision Outcome

The potential outcome of this decision is that we will be able to build the wallet closer to the end user, listening to their opinions and concerns.

### Consequences

The process may make the decision process longer, but it's better to make the decision a little longer than to make a bad decision.

## Validation

We will benchmark this process with the upcoming RFC and ADR entries.
