## Objective

The goal is to establish a unified RFC/ADR process that will help drive the wallet architecture and decisions, taking into account the voice of the community.

## Motivation

We strongly believe that Mina deserves a solid and user-centric wallet experience that is a solid gateway to the entire ecosystem. Building user-centric products is only possible by leveraging the voice of the community of a given ecosystem.

## User Benefit

The benefit would be to get a product that users want to use, not a product that we think is best for us.

## Design Proposal

We propose a Request For Comments and Architectural Decision Record flow that consists of asking the community for their feedback when starting to consider a particular feature or component for Pallad. Once we agree on a specific approach, we document the decision made in a separate ADR.


### Alternatives Considered

An alternative might be a discussion based on a feedback collection tool or GitHub Discussions. This approach does not preclude discussing product issues on Discord, GitHub Discussions, or GitHub Issues. It aims to quantify it.
