# `@palladco/key-management` Package - `chains` Subfolder Documentation

The `chains` subfolder of the `@palladco/key-management` package contains TypeScript modules that provide functionality related to key management, including credential derivation, key derivation, and signing operations specific to the Mina protocol. Each chain's folder follows a specific strucutre, below is an overview of each file for this strucutre within the `mina` subfolder as an example:

## `credentialDerivation.ts`

This module implements credential derivation functions specific to the Mina protocol. It includes methods for generating keypairs based on provided seeds and other parameters, emphasizing the creation of credentials that adhere to the Mina protocol's standards.

## `guards.ts`

Defines TypeScript type guards for the various types used across the `mina` subfolder. These guards are utility functions that perform runtime checks to ensure that objects conform to expected types, facilitating type-safe programming practices.

## `index.ts`

Serves as the entry point for the `mina` subfolder, re-exporting functions, types, and utilities defined in other modules. This arrangement allows consumers of the package to import various functionalities from a single, consolidated file.

## `keyDerivation.ts`

Focuses on the derivation of keys within the context of the Mina protocol. It includes functions for generating public/private key pairs from seeds, handling hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, and other related cryptographic operations.

## `keyDerivationUtils.ts`

Provides utility functions that support key derivation processes. These utilities include methods for manipulating seeds, generating random values according to specific cryptographic standards, and other foundational operations that underpin key derivation.

## `signingOperations.ts`

Contains functions related to signing operations, specifically tailored for the Mina protocol. It includes methods for signing transactions, verifying signatures, and other operations that ensure the integrity and authenticity of data within the Mina ecosystem.

## `types.ts`

Defines TypeScript interfaces and types that encapsulate the various data structures and entities involved in key management and cryptographic operations. This includes types for keys, signatures, and other cryptographic primitives.

Overall, the `mina` subfolder provides a comprehensive suite of tools for managing cryptographic keys and performing related operations within the Mina protocol, ensuring secure and efficient handling of authentication, authorization, and data integrity.
