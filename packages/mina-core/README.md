# @palladxyz/mina-core

@palladxyz/mina-core is a TypeScript package designed for helping other libraries to interact with Mina. It provides interfaces & types for many the main data structures of Mina that are relevant for wallets and applications. This includes providers that retrieve account information, process transaction history, submit transactions, and fetch health checks.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @palladxyz/mina-core
```

## Usage

### AccountInfoProvider

The `AccountInfoProvider` interface is used to fetch account information based on a public key.

```ts
import { AccountInfoProvider } from "@palladxyz/mina-core";

async function getAccountInfo(provider: AccountInfoProvider) {
  const accountInfo = await provider.getAccountInfo({ publicKey: "..." });
}
```

### ChainHistoryProvider

The `ChainHistoryProvider` interface provides methods to fetch transactions either by addresses or by hashes.

```ts
import { ChainHistoryProvider } from "@palladxyz/mina-core";

async function getTransactionsByAddresses(provider: ChainHistoryProvider) {
  const transactions = await provider.transactionsByAddresses({
    addresses: ["..."],
  });
}

async function getTransactionsByHashes(provider: ChainHistoryProvider) {
  const transactions = await provider.transactionsByHashes({ ids: ["..."] });
}
```

### TxSubmitProvider

The `TxSubmitProvider` interface allows you to submit signed transactions to the network.

```ts
import { TxSubmitProvider } from "@palladxyz/mina-core";

async function submitTx(provider: TxSubmitProvider) {
  const signedTx = // Prepare your signed transaction here
    await provider.submitTx({ signedTransaction: signedTx });
}
```

### Provider

All provider types extend the base Provider interface, which provides a health check method to verify if the provider is operational.

```ts
import { Provider } from "@palladxyz/mina-core";

async function checkHealth(provider: Provider) {
  const healthCheckResponse = await provider.healthCheck();
}
```

### Mina Core Types

This package also includes TypeScript definitions for some of the core data structures of Mina, which can be found under `./src/Mina/types`.

### Disclaimer

This package is still under development. Use it at your own risk and ensure to test thoroughly in your applications. Contributions and suggestions are welcomed!
